1. It's important to use PropTypes to find out what type of data a React component requires in order to render properly.

2. Lifecycle methods are special methods each component can have to allow us to hook into the views when specific conditions happen.

3. A higher order component is what we use for reusing an existing component. It is essentially a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

4. We can use inline styling if we can to do something quick or want to test how it looks in the broswer, import a CSS file when we got a lot more code and want to break it down into separate files and we mainly use styled components in React.
